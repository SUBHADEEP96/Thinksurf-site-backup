This is a step-by-step marketing where you earn profits by promoting other’s business or products. But this is not similar to referral marketing. It can rather be said that one company earns its economy in a passive way through this. In this revenue sharing technique, a company with its own product and a company lacking products both can fetch profits as it will promote the service of another company and earn its revenue from its affiliate marketer.
